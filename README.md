# Goalsetter MERN app

This is the goalsetter app I created following the [Learn the MERN Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0exw-9YJBo) series on YouTube.

The backend application was written in javascript using Node and Express, and it uses JWT authentication.

The frontend app was written in javascript using the Ract framework.

To start the project (both BE and FE) run the script ```npm run dev```.
